The focus of this project is to build out a template for a cooking blog.
For now, it will be set up to have one root user.  This root user will be the one writing the blog.
I'll probably right a simple js file to do the manual signup on the host machine.  

BACKEND

The backend will be a simple RESTful api.  The main focus on the backend will be querying the 
blog collection.
